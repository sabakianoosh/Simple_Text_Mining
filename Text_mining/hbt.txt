Why does it feel like night today?
Somethin in here not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia all I got left
I don know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head
Like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face watches every time I lie
A face that laughs every time I fall
(And watches everything)
So I know that when it time to sink or swim
That the face inside is here in me
Right underneath my skin
It like Im paranoid lookin over my back
It like a whirlwind inside of my head
It like I can stop what Im hearing within
It like the face inside is right beneath my skin
I know I got a face in me
Points out all my mistakes to me
You got a face on the inside too
And your paranoia probably worse
I don know what set me off first
But I know what I can stand
Everybody acts like the fact of the matter is
I can add up to what you can
But everybody has a face that they hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face watches every time they lie
A face that laughs every time they fall
(And watches everything)
So you know that when it time to sink or swim
That the face inside is watchin you too
Right inside your skin
It like Im paranoid lookin over my back
It like a whirlwind inside of my head
It like I can stop what Im hearing within
It like the face inside is right beneath the skin
It like Im paranoid lookin over my back
It like a whirlwind inside of my head
It like I can stop what Im hearing within
It like the face inside is right beneath my skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me
The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me
It like Im paranoid lookin over my back
It like a whirlwind inside of my head
It like I can stop what Im hearing within
It like the face inside is right beneath the skin
It like Im paranoid lookin over my back
It like a whirlwind inside of my head
It like I can stop what Im hearing within
It like I can stop what Im hearing within
It like I can stop what Im hearing within
It like the face inside is right beneath my skin
I cannot take this anymore
Im saying everything I said before
All these words they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Less I hear the less you say
But you find that out anyway
Just like before
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And Im about to break
I need a little room to breathe
Cause Im one step closer to the edge
And Im about to break
I find the answers aren so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again
Just like before
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And Im about to break
I need a little room to breathe
Cause Im one step closer to the edge
And Im about to break
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And Im about to break
I need a little room to breathe
Cause Im one step closer to the edge
And Im about to, break
Shut up when Im talking to you
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up when Im talking to you
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up, Im about to break!
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And Im about to break
I need a little room to breathe
Cause Im one step closer to the edge
And Im about to break
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And Im about to break
I need a little room to breathe
Cause Im one step closer to the edge
And Im about to, break
I woke up in a dream today
To the cold of the static and put my cold feet on the floor
Forgot all about yesterday
Remembering Im pretending to be where Im not anymore
A little taste of hypocrisy
And Im left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react
Even though you so close to me
You still so distant and I can bring you back
It true
The way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you not with me
Im with you
You now I see
Keeping everything inside (with you)
You now I see
Even when I close my eyes
I hit you and you hit me back
We fall to the floor, the rest of the day stands still
Fine line between this and that
When things go wrong I pretend that the past isn real
Now Im trapped in this memory
And Im left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react
So even though you close to me
You still so distant and I can bring you back
It true
The way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you not with me
Im with you
You now I see
Keeping everything inside (with you)
You now I see
Even when I close my eyes
Im with you
You now I see
Keeping everything inside (with you)
You now I see
Even when I close my eyes
No, no matter how far we come
I can wait to see tomorrow
No matter how far we come I
I can wait to see tomorrow
With you
You now I see
Keeping everything inside (with you)
You now I see
Even when I close my eyes
With you
You now I see
Keeping everything inside (with you)
You now I see
Even when I close my eyes
forfeit the game, before somebody takes you out of the frame
and put your name to shame, cover up your face
You can run the race, the pace is too fast, you just won last
forfeit the game, before somebody takes you out of the frame
and put your name to shame, cover up your face
You can run the race, the pace is too fast, you just won last
Won last, won last, won last, won last, won last, won last
Won last, won last, won last, won last, won last, won last
Won last
You love the way, I look at you
While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through
You take away if I give in
My life, my pride is broken
You like to think you never wrong
(You like to think you never wrong)
You have to act like you someone
(You have to act like you someone)
You want someone to hurt like you
(You want someone to hurt like you)
You want to share what you been through
(You live what you learned)
You love the things, I say I do
The way I hurt myself again, just to get back at you
You take away, when I give in
My life, my pride is broken
You like to think you never wrong
(You like to think you never wrong)
You have to act like you someone
(You have to act like you someone)
You want someone to hurt like you
(You want someone to hurt like you)
You wanna share what you been through
(You live what you learned)
Yo, yo, forfeit the game, before somebody takes you out of the frame
Put your name to shame, cover up your face
You can run the race, the pace is too fast, you just won last
Forfeit the game, before somebody takes you out of the frame
Put your name to shame, cover up your face
You can run the race, the pace is too fast, you just won last
Won last, won last, won last, won last, won last, won last

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real
There something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming, confusing
This lack of self control I fear is never ending
Controlling
I can seem
To find myself again
My walls are closing in
(Without a sense of confidence, Im convinced)
(That there just too much pressure to take)
I felt this way before
So insecure
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real
Discomfort, endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting, reacting
Against my will I stand beside my own reflection
It haunting
How I can seem
To find myself again
My walls are closing in
(Without a sense of confidence, Im convinced)
(That there just too much pressure to take)
I felt this way before
So insecure
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing, confusing what is real
There something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming (confusing what is real)
This lack of self control I fear is never ending
Controlling (confusing what is real)
Graffiti decorations
Under the sky of dust
A constant wave of tension
On top of broken trust
The lessons that you taught me
I learned were never true
Now I find myself in question
(They point the finger at me again)
Guilty by association
(You point the finger at me again)
I wanna run away
Never say "goodbye"
I wanna know the truth
Instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers
No more lies
I wanna shut the door
And open up my mind
Paper bags and angry voices
Under a sky of dust
Another wave of tension
Has more than filled me up
All my talk of taking action
These words were never true
Now I find myself in question
(They point the finger at me again)
Guilty by association
(You point the finger at me again)
I wanna run away
Never say "goodbye"
I wanna know the truth
Instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers
No more lies
I wanna shut the door
And open up my mind
Im gonna run away and never say "goodbye"
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Im gonna run away and never wonder why
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Im gonna run away and open up my mind
Gonna run away, gonna run away (mind)
Gonna run away, gonna run away (mind)
Gonna run away, gonna run away (mind)
Gonna run away, gonna run away (mind)
I wanna run away
Never say "goodbye"
I wanna know the truth
Instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers
No more lies
I wanna shut the door
And open up my mind
I wanna run away and open up my mind
I wanna run away and open up my mind
I wanna run away and open up my mind
I wanna run away and open up my mind
One thing I don know why
It doesn even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It so unreal
Didn look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin to hold on, did-didn even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside and even though I tried
It all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn even matter
One thing, I don know why
It doesn even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
Im surprised it got so far
Things aren the way they were before
You wouldn even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside and even though I tried
It all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn even matter
I put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There only one thing you should know
I put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There only one thing you should know
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn even matter
I watch how the moon
Sits in the sky in the dark night
Shining with the light from the sun
And the sun doesn give light to the moon assuming
The moon going to owe it one
It makes me think of how you act to me
You do
Favors then rapidly, you just
Turn around and start asking me about
Things you want back from me
Im sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest
I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you don understand
(You see it not meant to be)
I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head
Maybe someday I be just like you and
Step on people like you do and
Run away all the people I thought I knew
I remember back then who you were
You used to be calm, used to be strong
Used to be generous but you should known
That youd
Wear out your welcome now you see
How quiet it is all alone
Im so
Sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest
Im so
Sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest
I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you don understand
(You see it not meant to be)
I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head
You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away
I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you don understand
(You see it not meant to be)
I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head
Stay away
Im so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger (stay)
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed (a-)
While I find a place to rest
Im so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger (-way)
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place, to feed your greed (stay away from me)
While I find a place to rest
I lied to you
The same way that I always do
This is the last smile
That I fake for the sake of being with you
Everything falls apart
Even the people who never frown eventually break down
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
Everything has to end
You soon find we out of time left to watch it all unwind
The sacrifice is never knowing
Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see you testing me, pushes me away
Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see you testing me, pushes me away
I tried, like you
To do everything you wanted to
This is the last time
  take the blame for the sake of being with you
Everything falls apart
Even the people who never frown eventually break down
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
Everything has to end
You soon find we out of time left to watch it all unwind
The sacrifice is never knowing
Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see youtesting me, pushes me away
Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see you testing me, pushes me away
We all out of time, this is how we find how it all unwinds
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
We all out of time, this is how we find how it all unwinds
The sacrifice is never knowing
Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see you testing me, pushes me away
Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see you testing me, pushes me away
Pushes me away
From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture there
The memory won escape me
But why should I care?
From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture there
The memory won escape me
But why should I care?
There a place so dark you can see the end
(Skies cock back) and shock that which can defend
The rain then sends dripping acidic questions
Forcefully, the power of suggestion
Then with the eyes shut looking through the rust and rot, and dust
A small spot of light floods the floor
And pours over the rusted world of pretend
And the eyes ease open and it dark again
From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture there
The memory won escape me
But why should I care?
In the memory you find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up
Moving all around
Screaming of the ups and downs
Pollution manifested in perpetual sound
The wheels go round and the sunset creeps
Behind street lamps, chain-link, and concrete
A little piece of paper with a picture drawn
Floats on down the street il the wind is gone
And the memory now is like the picture was then
When the paper crumpled up it can be perfect again
From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture there
The memory won escape me
But why should I care?
From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture there
The memory won escape me
But why should I care?
In the memory you find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up
Now you got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back
Telling you that I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back
Telling you that I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back
Telling you that I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back
Telling you that I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back
Telling you that I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back
Telling you that I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back
Telling you that I see it right through you
In the memory you find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up
In the memory you find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up
